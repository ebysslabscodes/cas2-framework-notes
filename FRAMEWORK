# CAS 2.0 Framework

## Purpose

CAS 2.0 is an evaluation framework for studying the **long-horizon behavior of adaptive systems** under sustained stochastic exposure.

The framework is designed to surface behaviors that do not reliably appear in short-horizon or intervention-heavy evaluations, including gradual drift, variance accumulation, and changes in recovery dynamics over time.

CAS 2.0 treats **time itself as a stressor**, rather than assuming meaningful risk manifests early.

## What CAS 2.0 Is

CAS 2.0 is:
- an evaluation framework
- a methodology for longitudinal analysis
- a tool for studying persistence and degradation under fixed conditions

It is designed to observe behavior, not to improve it.

---

## What CAS 2.0 Is Not

CAS 2.0 is explicitly **not**:
- a training system
- an optimization framework
- a performance benchmark
- a tuning or control loop
- a deployment architecture

No claims of improved performance, safety, or alignment are made by the framework itself.

---

## Core Framework Constraints

CAS 2.0 enforces the following constraints across evaluations:

- **Frozen parameters**  
  All parameters are declared prior to execution and remain fixed for the duration of a run.

- **No intervention**  
  No mid-run tuning, resets, or corrective actions are permitted.

- **Sustained stochastic exposure**  
  Noise is continuously injected according to a predefined process.

- **Time as the independent variable**  
  Differences across evaluation phases are attributed to increased horizon length, not configuration changes.

These constraints are intentionally strict to isolate temporal effects.

## Adaptive Response vs Optimization

Adaptive mechanisms within CAS 2.0 are not treated as learning or optimization processes.

Response parameters (e.g., gain, period) define **how** a system reacts to incoming noise.  
They do not evolve and are not modified based on outcomes.

Observed behavior informs **what to evaluate next**, not **how to tune the system**.

---

## Evaluation Focus

CAS 2.0 evaluations emphasize:
- boundedness over time
- variance structure under prolonged exposure
- persistence and degradation of recovery behavior
- absence of abrupt collapse despite increasing exposure

The framework is intentionally agnostic to task performance or reward maximization.

---

## Interpretability and Auditability

CAS 2.0 prioritizes:
- clear experimental boundaries
- traceable evaluation phases
- reproducible comparison logic
- explicit documentation of constraints

Manual execution and logging are used to preserve interpretability and prevent accidental intervention.

---

## Scope Limitations

CAS 2.0 does not attempt to model:
- adversarial interaction
- non-stationary objectives
- real-world deployment complexity
- human-in-the-loop systems

Results should be interpreted as **methodological observations**, not guarantees of system safety or reliability.
