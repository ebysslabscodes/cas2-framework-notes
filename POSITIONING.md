Purpose

This document clarifies how CAS 2.0 is positioned relative to other research frameworks, evaluation approaches, and system-development efforts.

CAS 2.0 is an evaluative research framework, not a system, intervention method, or tool intended for deployment, optimization, or control. This document exists to prevent misclassification of CAS 2.0 and to establish clear conceptual boundaries.

CAS 2.0 as an Evaluative Framework

CAS 2.0 is designed to observe long-horizon behavioral phenomena in adaptive systems under sustained stochastic exposure and frozen parameters.

It does not act on systems, modify them, or attempt to improve their behavior. Its role is strictly observational and comparative across time horizons.

CAS 2.0 should be understood as a lens for evaluation, not as a component within a system lifecycle or deployment pipeline.

Relationship to Other Research Areas
Complementary to Alignment Research

CAS 2.0 does not perform alignment, enforce objectives, or evaluate goal adherence.

It is complementary to alignment research insofar as it may surface long-horizon behavioral patterns that alignment methods may wish to consider or test against, without asserting alignment properties itself.

Complementary to Training and Learning Frameworks

CAS 2.0 does not train systems, adjust parameters, or modify learning dynamics.

It may be applied to observe how trained or adaptive systems behave over extended exposure, but it does not participate in or guide training processes.

Complementary to Monitoring and Evaluation Systems

CAS 2.0 differs from runtime monitoring systems in that it:

does not operate during deployment

does not trigger alerts or interventions

does not enforce thresholds or controls

Instead, it provides offline, constrained evaluation focused on time-dependent behavior under fixed conditions.

Orthogonal to Optimization and Deployment

CAS 2.0 is intentionally orthogonal to:

optimization pipelines

performance benchmarking

deployment architectures

operational decision systems

It does not aim to improve system performance, efficiency, or robustness, nor does it evaluate readiness for real-world use.

What CAS 2.0 Is Not

CAS 2.0 is explicitly not:

a controller

an agent

a stabilizer

a safety mechanism

a deployment framework

It does not:

intervene in system behavior

enforce constraints dynamically

provide operational guarantees

certify system properties

Any interpretation of CAS 2.0 as an active system component constitutes misclassification.

Intended Use Context

CAS 2.0 is intended for:

research exploration of long-horizon behavior

methodological study of temporal exposure effects

evaluation design discussion

comparative analysis across time horizons

It is not intended for:

production systems

real-time decision-making

safety certification

operational risk mitigation

Position Summary

CAS 2.0 occupies a distinct and narrow position:

evaluative, not operative

observational, not corrective

methodological, not performative

complementary, not competitive

This positioning is deliberate and central to the framework’s integrity.
